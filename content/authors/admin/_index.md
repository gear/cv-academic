I am a PhD candidate at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](<https://www.titech.ac.jp/english>) and a visiting researcher at [RIKEN AIP](<https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/>).
My research interests include the universality of graph learning models (e.g. graph neural networks, graph kernels) and the kernel approach to explain over-parameterization in general neural networks.
