abstract: In this paper, we study the graph classification problem from the
  graph homomorphism perspective. We consider the homomorphisms from H to G,
  where G is a graph of interest (e.g. molecules or social networks) and H
  belongs to some family F of graphs (e.g. paths or non-isomorphic trees). We
  show that graph homomorphism numbers provide a natural invariant (isomorphism
  invariant and F-invariant) embedding maps which can be used for graph
  classification. Viewing the expressive power of a graph classifier by the
  -indistinguishable concept, we prove the universality property of graph
  homomorphism vectors in approximating F-invariant functions. In practice, by
  choosing  whose elements have bounded tree-width, we show that the
  homomorphism method is efficient compared with other methods.
